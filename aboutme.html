								<h2>United States Army<br />
								Signal School</h2>
								<p>During the eight years I served in the U.S. Army. My first four years I learned how a radio signal works and how to us a device
							        to encrypted that signal. I also spent time working with FM antennas, Ku satellite nodes, and IT help desk.
								My second four years I works as part of Network Operations and Information Security. During this time I worked with Ku Satellite nodes,
								Cisco routers and switches, and Cisco VOIP phones. I also monitored the network to make sure that if a Node went down I could assist them
								to ensure that there was minimal downtime. I also made sure that there were no security incidents having to do with unauthorized netowork
								access.</p>

								<h2>Desktop Support Specialist<br />

								<p>After serving in the U.S. Army I started working at Strong View systems using Norton Ghost imaging software to create standard images to reduce
								 the time it took to setup a new workstation. I managed all Mital VOIP phones, Google accounts in G-suit for email, and Active Directory
								accounts. I was responsable for taking inventory of all workstations and servers, and ewasting all workstations that were at the end their lifecycle
								at our company if they could not be donated to schools. Workstatiosn that could be donated had all of their harddrives whiped using DBAN type software.
								I used a ticketing system like remedy to allow users to put in a request for assistance and to assist with storing inventory information.</p>
