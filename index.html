								<h2>United States Army<br />
								Signal School</h2>
								<p>The eight years I served in the U.S. Army I spent it doing two jobs. My first four years I spent learning how to do a job working with radio signals and how to us a device
							        to encrypt those signals. Part of that job included spenting time working with FM radios, Ku satellite nodes, and working as a IT help desk clerk.
								My second four years my job changed and I was part of Network Operations and Information Security. During this time I worked with Ku Satellite nodes,
								Cisco routers and switches, and Cisco VOIP phones. I would use Solar Winds software to monitor the network to make sure that if a Node went down I was there to bring it back up or
								help someone bring it back up to ensure that there was minimal downtime. Another part of my job was ensuring that no unauthorized access to the network occurred and that if it did that it was
								promptly ended and reported in a swift manner.</p>

								<h2>Desktop Support Specialist<br />
								</h2>
								<p>After serving in the U.S. Army I started working at Strong View systems as a Desktop support specialist where I used Norton Ghost imaging software to create standard images to reduce
								the time it took to setup a new workstation. I managed all Mital VOIP phones, Google accounts in G-suit for email, and Active Directory
								accounts. I was responsable for taking inventory of all workstations and servers, and e-wasting all workstations that were at the end their lifecycle.
								I manage to partner with a nonprofit to take those workstation and with our company's permission donated to underserved schools were kids that went there could use them. To do this workstations that were donated had all of their harddrives whiped using a DBAN type software.
